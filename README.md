# Code for paper: Robust Controllability of Boolean Control Networks with Dynamic Programming

## Organization
- *RobustControllability*: source code of core algorithms
- *examples*: implementation of examples in the paper

## How to run
0. Install [Julia v1.10 or higher](https://julialang.org/downloads/) if not yet.
1. Launch Julia REPL
2. Change to the *examples* directory in REPL if not done yet (please use your actual path instead)

   ```julia
    julia> cd(raw"E:\GitHub\bcn_rc\examples")
   ```

3. Enter ] into package mode, and then activate the environment in *examples*

   ```
   julia> ]activate .
   ```

4. Instantiate the *examples* environment, which will install required packages automatically.

   ```
   (examples) pkg> instantiate
   ```

5. Press backspace to return to the normal REPL mode. Then, change to a specific subpath as you want, e.g., to *tiny*

   ```julia
   julia> cd("./tiny")
   ```

6. Run Julia scripts according to instructions in that specific folder, e.g., if we want to execute the "net.jl" script, just `include` it

   ```julia
   julia> include("./net.jl")
   ```

7. If you noticed an output saying `Threads.nthreads() = 1`, it implies that your Julia is not enabled for multi-threading. 
   Please set the environment variable [`JULIA_NUM_THREADS`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/environment-variables/#JULIA_NUM_THREADS) to `auto` to enable it.


# Causion
Currently, we use very small integer type `UInt8` to reduce memory usage.
As a result, the allowed number of control variables is at most 7, and the maximum $T^*$ for robust controllability is allowed to 255.

If this is not the actual case, please use a wider integer type in [types.jl](RobustControllability/src/types.jl).
